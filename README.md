# Human or Animal?

## Humanity's Darkest Hour

Where children cry, where mothers breathe their last, where fathers watch helplessly... Humanity is being tested.

States prepare generations for this darkness. They plant seeds of hatred in schools, tell false stories through media, and numb consciences. And in the end... humans turn into beasts against their own kind.

## Being Human

One is born human, but living as a human is a choice.

A human:
- Cannot touch a child's tears
- Does not silence a mother's cry
- Stands where innocent blood flows and says, "No!"
- Does not turn their own pain into another's suffering
- Chooses love despite hatred
- Tries to be light even in darkness

**To be human: Never silencing the voice of conscience for any power.**

## Being an Animal

An animal, however:
- Does what they're told without question
- Ignores a child's scream
- Pays for their own fear with another's life
- Surrenders to hatred
- Spreads their own pain to the entire world
- Gets lost in darkness

**To be an animal: Laying your conscience under the feet of power, hatred, and fear.**

## The Day of Test

Every day in this world is a day of test. Every moment we make a choice:
- Mercy or cruelty?
- Justice or oppression?
- To protect or to destroy?

Even in humanity's most ruthless periods... some chose to remain human. Even if they sacrificed their own lives, they did not sell their consciences.

## Final Word

You only have your own choice in your hands. No system, no leader, no propaganda can force you to become an animal... if you decide to remain human.

**Are you human or animal?**

**Only you can answer this question.**

**And this answer... lies not only in your words, but in your actions.**
